		- User does not know what is happening inside the ATM.

	- We don't have to handle ==resource management== and ==memory allocation==.
	- We don't have to handle ==garbage collection.==
	- Reduces details so that developers can ==focus on logic better.==
	- Improves ==understandibility== as well as ==maintainability== of the code.
