- ### Block Level Element:
- A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
```html
<h1>
<p>
```
- ### Inline Elements:
- An inline element does not start  on a new line.
- An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
```html
<li>
<span>
<cite>
```
