# Key Points
- Graph is like to tree.
- But Graph is parent and tree is children.
- In Graph can posible multiple edge.
- Graph has a multiple way to traverse in a single node.
- Graph can possible cycle traversing.
- Graph is followed both edge directions.
# Types of Grapha
- ==Undirected graph==
	- Ease of edge have both directions.
- ==Directed graph==
	- Any of edge if have a single way of directions.
- ==Weighted graph==
	- Have any weight this graph.
- ==Unweighted graph==
	- Not have any weight if have just 1.
- ==Cycle graph==
	- Minimun 3 nodes have for making cycle graph.
	- 2 nodes not allow for cycle graph.Becaue if 2 nodes cycyle after I can't increase node size.
	- Only undirected graph can posible to make cycle graph.
