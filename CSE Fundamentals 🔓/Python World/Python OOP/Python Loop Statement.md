- # While Loop
```python

while i < 6:
	print(i)
	i += 1
```
- # Do While Loop
- If use break statement then else block couldn't be executed.
```python
i = 0
while i < 6:
	print(i)
	i += 1
	if i == 6: 
		break
else:
	print("if condition is false then it will be print")

# real example
i = 0
while i > 6:
	print(i)
	i += 1
else:
	print("if condition is false then it will be print")
```
- # For Loop
```python
for i in range(start, end, increment):
	print(i)

```python

```
- # Break
```python
i = 0
while i < 10
	print(i)

- # Continue
```python
